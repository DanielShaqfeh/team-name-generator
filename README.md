# Team Name Generator

This project is built as part of my learning journey with the **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js).  
It's a simple web app using Node.js, Express, and EJS that generates random **team names** â€” for competitive programming contests, or any other IT-related teams.  
Includes basic CSS styling for a clean and lightweight look.
